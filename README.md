# The Wiki....

After nearly 20 years of building anything but a wiki, I came to the conclusion that I just like wikis too much. 
Sadly the best one is mediawiki and it is crap. So here comes my own.
It might be an excuse to learn JS usability, too.

## v1 - for myself
* Write in Markdown
* save in DB (via peewee), because filebased would be nice but has too many problems for most users.
   * still: export markdown files for every page.
* do categories as hashtags

## v2 - make it publishable
* generate a static page afterwards

## v3 - javascrip the hell out of it
* generate a JS index (admit it, you've been wanting to do that for ages!)
* JS-highlight text to create a new page
